"John Nash's Demon"

Hi Everyone and Welcome to our project for the Data Structures And Algorithms. Our project contains 4 games with in a game and we generated a bot that plays the game with the user which are implemented using various data structures and algorithms. Following is the list of games that we made:
1) Tic-Tac-Toe
2) Domineering
3) Hex
4) Pick The Block

The data structures that were used are:
- Stacks
- Queues
- Nested lists (or Arrays)

The Algorithms Used in the process are:
- MiniMax ( visit: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/ )
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Depth-First Search

How to Operate:

Since this project is made on Python 3, the pre-requisites to operate our project are:

- Installation of Python 3 IDE
- Installation of pygame library (using command "pip install pygame" or visit: https://pypi.org/project/pygame/ )
