*"John Nash's Demon" - Combinatorial Game bot*

Hi Everyone and Welcome to our project for the Data Structures And Algorithms. Our project contains 4 games with in a game and we generated a bot that plays the game with the user which are implemented using various data structures and algorithms. Following is the list of games that we made:
1) Tic-Tac-Toe
2) Domineering
3) Hex
4) Pick The Block

The data structures that were used are:
- Game Tree
- Stacks
- Queues
- Nested lists (or Arrays)

The Algorithms Used in the process are:
- MiniMax (visit: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/)
- Alpha-Beta Pruning (visit: https://www.javatpoint.com/ai-alpha-beta-pruning)
- Depth-First Search

How to Operate:

Since this project is made on Python 3, the pre-requisites to operate our project are:

- Installation of Python 3 IDE
- Installation of pygame library (using command "pip install pygame" or visit: https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)

Once the pre-requisites are met, you have to simply run the code, which will resullt in the opening of a User-Interface that we created using pygame. It will have four buttons, each of which leads to the mentioned game when clicked. For Tic-Tac-Toe, Pick The Block and Hex, you have to simply click on the area to score a move there. For Domineering, you have to click on two adjacent blocks to place a rectangular piece on that respective area. In addition to this, there is a "Home" button on the top of the Window while playing a certain game. This button leads back to the home menu, i.e. the menu where we can access all the games. Have fun Playing these Combinatorial Games !!
